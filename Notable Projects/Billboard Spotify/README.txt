Make a Spotify playlist of 100 songs.
In this program, you have to enter a date of your choice in the format YYYY-MM-DD. 
It searches Billboard for hot 100 songs for that day. 
This program scrapes the web using beautiful soup and then store the name of all 100 songs in a TXT file. 
The program then uses Spotify API to search for songs in the TXT file. 
If the song exists, the program creates a new playlist titled the 'date' you entered and add the song to that playlist
