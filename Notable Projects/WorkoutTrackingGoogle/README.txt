The highlight of this project is that it uses Natural Language Processing AI module to process the input by the user.
For example:
        Typical program:
		Input exercise:
		Run
		How long did you exercise?
		10min
		Next exercise?
		Walk
		How long did you exercise?
		5min
	Natural Language Processing:
		Describe your exercise:
		I ran for 10min and walked for 5min

Both these menthods stores the same data. 

This program the calculates how many calories you burnt based on your input.
